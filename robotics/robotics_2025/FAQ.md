# Pre-Hackathon Preparation

Please do the item ahead to join the Hackathon in field. That would save your time to focus on the Missions.

1. Understand the rules well by reading the [AMD Open Robotics Hackathon](https://amdroboticshackathon.datamonsters.com/)
2. Read the documentation from [ROCm/AMD_Hackathon Repo](https://github.com/ROCm/AMD_Hackathon/tree/main/robotics/robotics_2025) on how to set up the environment and what you need to submit for the Missions.
3. To store your datasets, models, and training logs, register for your personal Hugging Face and Weights & Biases (W&B) accounts before the Hackathon begins.
4. Go through https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/main/en/il_robots if this is your first time using LeRobot and the SO101 Arm.
5. Learn to use Jupyter Notebook. We will assign an MI300X Virtual Machine (VM) to each team for training and for copying data between your local machine and the VM.
